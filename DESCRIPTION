Description: RNAeditr analyzes site-specific RNA editing events, as well as
  hyper-editing  regions. The editing frequencies can be tested against binary,
  continuous or survival outcomes. Multiple covariate variables as well as
  interaction effects can also be incorporated in the statistical models.
